## *IDEA* behind adding some Paricular Features / Driving Forces
### **1. Download Chat Feature**
If a professor uses the product and he/she wants to save all the "in chat" discussions locally in his system, he/she can simply download the chat messages along with date, time and sender's name in one click ( instead of copy-pasting the entire chat )
### **2. Whiteboard**
In the era of everything being online, a feature like collaborative whiteboard is surely a useful one. It can be used to explain stuff to other participants in the room or simply as a relaxation tool ( playing [scribble](https://skribbl.io/) or doodling )
<br>
*Everything on the board can be easily downloaded as an image in one click. A better UX as now the user doesn't need to take screenshots ( if needed )*

### **3. Video Stream Recording**
There might be a case where an instructor wants to record the session but not the entire screen, just the content he delivered in the session. That's where the necessity of this feature arrises. 
### **4. Hiding Incoming Videos / Muting Incoming Audios**
Surely a very useful feature in *Microsoft Teams* as it ensures that we can opt to hide/unhide ( mute/unmute ) remote video (audio) streams according to our internet connection / distraction level.
*Useful when a speaker in the room wants to avoid any kind of disturbance.*
### **5. Download Attendees Activity**
The person who starts the meeting / creates the room may want to keep a record of which participant joined/left at what time, or, simply track the attendance. This feature allows to download all this activity in one click.

# Approach Towards Building the Project
### Development Methodology - Scrum Methodology
**Agile Scrum Methodology** is basically incremental development i.e. we build the product in iterations, step by step.
We work in “Sprints” where each sprint lasts for a week or two, and focus on building the important features first and 
then improve the product to make it more potential.

### Here are the sprints I had set for myself for the 4 week journey 😄

#### INITIAL DAYS ( WEEK 0 )
1. Learning more about Backend Development
2. Researching about how video conferencing apps work ; what technologies / APIs / SDKs are used
3. Deciding the Tech Stack and finding suitable resources
4. Designing my product (using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) )

#### WEEK 1
1. Setting up the server and adding the functionality to access the webcam and microphone to stream my own video
2. Connecting other clients to have a simple video call ( MINIMUM REQUIRED FUNCTIONALITY )
3. Adding Video/Audio Toggle Buttons
4. Designing Landing Page
5. Learning about how random Room IDs can be generated

#### WEEK 2
1. Adding Create Room / Copy Room code / Leave Room Functionality
2. Setting a custom Room Name corresponding to Room Code every time a new Room is created **( not implemented as of now, But sure of doing it in near future )**
3. Adding Ability to set username before entering a room
4. Styling the room page according to the design planned
5. Adding Chat Feature - send and view messages along with the sender’s name and the time at which message is sent.
6. Adding EmojiPicker in Chat **( not implemented as of now, But sure of doing it in near future )**

#### WEEK 3
1. Adding features which are included in almost all video conferencing apps – Screen Sharing, 'Screen / Video Stream' Recording
2. Adding Hand Raise Feature
3. Adding Whiteboard Feature ( A really useful feature which can be used to clear friends’ doubts or simply play scribble )
4. Taking inspiration from Microsoft Teams – Adding ability to send reactions, Mute incoming videos / audios
5. Making the product mobile responsive and improving UI/UX

#### WEEK 4
1. Adding easy yet useful features – Saving whiteboard as an image / downloading chat messages / downloading attendees activity
2. Attaching database ( [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/) ) to persist messages in order to continue conversation anytime later ( TRYING TO IMPLEMENT SURPRISE FEATURE )
3. Adding user authentication ➡️ displaying the list of Rooms a user is part of on the Landing page itself
**( not implemented as of now, But sure of doing it in near future )**
4. Deploying the application on Heroku – Main motive being, taking inputs from family members, friends and mentors - What improvements can be made
5. Improving UI/UX on the basis of reviews from family members, friends and mentors.
6. Working on making Video Demo & updating README.md
