## *IDEA* behind adding some Paricular Features / Driving Forces
### **1. Download Chat Feature**
If a professor uses the product and he/she wants to save all the "in chat" discussions locally in his system, he/she can simply download the chat messages along with date, time and sender's name in one click ( instead of copy-pasting the entire chat )
### **2. Whiteboard**
In the era of everything being online, a feature like collaborative whiteboard is surely a useful one. It can be used to explain stuff to other participants in the room or simply as a relaxation tool ( playing [scribble](https://skribbl.io/) or doodling )
<br><br>
*Everything on the board can be easily downloaded as an image in one click. A better UX as now the user doesn't need to take screenshots ( if needed )*

### **3. Video Stream Recording**
There might be a case where an instructor wants to record the session but not the entire screen, just the content he delivered in the session. That's where the necessity of this feature arrises. 
### **4. Hiding Incoming Videos / Muting Incoming Audios**
Surely a very useful feature in *Microsoft Teams* as it ensures that we can opt to hide/unhide ( mute/unmute ) remote video (audio) streams according to our internet connection / distraction level.
*Useful when a speaker in the room wants to avoid any kind of disturbance.*
### **5. Download Attendees Activity**
The person who starts the meeting / creates the room may want to keep a record of which participant joined/left at what time, or, simply track the attendance. This feature allows to download all this activity in one click.

# Approach Towards Building the Project
### Development Methodology - Scrum Methodology
**Agile Scrum Methodology** is basically incremental development i.e. we build the product in iterations, step by step. <br><br>
We work in ‚ÄúSprints‚Äù where each sprint lasts for a week or two, and focus on building the important features first and then improve the product to make it more potential.

### Here are the sprints I had set for myself for the 4 week journey üòÑ

#### WEEK 0 ( INITIAL DAYS )
1. **Learning** more about Backend Development
2. **Researching** about how video conferencing apps work ; what technologies / APIs / SDKs are used
3. **Deciding the Tech Stack** and finding suitable resources
4. **Designing** my product (using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) )

#### WEEK 1 ( BUILD PHASE )
1. Setting up the server and adding the functionality to access the webcam and microphone to stream my own video
2. Connecting other clients to have a simple video call **( MINIMUM REQUIRED FUNCTIONALITY )**
3. Adding Video/Audio Toggle Buttons
4. Adding features that may enhance **User Experience** ( Adding Create Room / Copy Room code Feature )
5. **Styling and Testing**
<br>

**ISSUES :**
Setting a custom Room Name corresponding to Room Code every time a new Room is created **( not implemented as of now, But sure of doing it in near future )**

#### WEEK 2 ( BUILD PHASE )
1. Adding **Basic Chat Feature** - send and view messages along with the sender‚Äôs name and the time at which message is sent.
2. Adding features which are included in almost all video conferencing apps ‚Äì Screen Sharing, 'Screen / Video Stream' Recording
3. Adding Hand Raise Feature
4. Taking inspiration from Microsoft Teams ‚Äì Adding ability to send reactions, Mute incoming videos / audios
<br>

**ISSUES :**
Adding EmojiPicker in Chat **( not implemented as of now, But sure of doing it in near future )**

#### WEEK 3 ( X-FACTOR TIME )
1. **Examining** and planning useful features for Meet-Up
2. Adding Whiteboard ( A really useful feature which can be used to clear friends‚Äô doubts or simply play [scribble](https://skribbl.io/) )
4. Adding **easy yet useful features** ‚Äì Saving whiteboard as an image / downloading chat messages / downloading attendees activity
5. Making the product **Responsive and Improving UI/UX**
<br>

**ISSUES :**
Ability to Draw on Whiteboard using Screen Touch **( not implemented as of now, But sure of doing it in near future )**

#### WEEK 4 ( ADAPT PHASE )
1. Attaching database ( [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/) ) to persist messages in order to continue conversation anytime later **( TRYING TO IMPLEMENT SURPRISE FEATURE )**
3. Adding user authentication ‚û°Ô∏è displaying the list of Rooms a user is part of on the Landing page itself
**( not implemented as of now, But sure of doing it in near future )**
4. **Deploying the application** on Heroku ‚Äì Main motive being, taking inputs from family members, friends and mentors - What improvements can be made
5. **Improving UI/UX** on the basis of reviews from family members, friends and mentors.
6. Working on making Video Demo & updating README.md
